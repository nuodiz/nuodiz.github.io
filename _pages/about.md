ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is Nuodi. I am a PhD candidate in [Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies](https://cehhs.fsu.edu/islt) at Florida State University. You can check my CV [here](https://nuodiz.github.io/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf).

My research interests revolve around creating equitable learning opportunities for every learner, regardless of gender, ability, disability, and race,  by designing, implementing, and evaluating emerging technologies. I have been working with children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in designing and creating creative objects in virtual worlds and puzzle gameplay, which helped them develop essential transferable skills such as computational thinking and socio-emotional skills. I am also interested in designing AI-supported simulations to enhance preservice teachers' capacity to deliver responsible and equitable instruction.
