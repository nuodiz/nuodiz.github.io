ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is Nuodi. I am a PhD candidate in [Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies](https://cehhs.fsu.edu/islt) at Florida State University. 
<!-- You can check my CV [here](https://nuodiz.github.io/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf). -->

My research interests revolve around creating equitable learning opportunities for every learner, regardless of gender, ability, disability, and race,  by designing, implementing, and evaluating emerging technologies. I am particularly interested in how technology can be leveraged to reduce learning barriers and promote inclusion in both formal and informal educational contexts. Currently, my work explores the use of diverse **AI tools** in STEM education, including AI-supported simulations that foster adaptive, hands-on learning experiences, and AI-driven chatbots that serve as interactive learning partners and instructional supports. I have been working with children and adolescents with **neurodiversity** including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in designing and creating creative objects in **virtual worlds** and [puzzle gameplay](https://www.terc.edu/terc_products/zoombinis/), which helped them develop essential transferable skills such as computational thinking and socio-emotional skills.
